Hello, everyone!

This week we feature Anthony Chiboucas, a very active Neo4j Community member.

In this issue, Florent Biville invites you to test the new tool to migrate from liquigraph to liquibase that can help you migrate your Neo4j databases.
GraphAware and Breadcrumbs collaborated on a project to analyze a graph with billions of crypto transactions and visualize the data.
The folks at Osinto who provide subscriptions to their knowledge graphs provide a site where you can visualize data and relationships in 3D using Cloud Empire.
Jennifer Reif loaded a Neo4j database with Java library data and shows how to analyze the differences between Java versions.
Meet Suvariya wrote a beginners tutorial aimed at data scientists for exploring the graph and also shows how to use Gephi to visualize the data.
Neo4j engineers have released version 2.2.0 of the GraphQL Library.
Adamantios - Marios Berzovitis released GraphKer for performing cybersecurity checks on your graphs.

And finally, we leave you withe the links to the most popular video series produced by the Developer Relations team.


We hope you enjoy this weeks news.

Cheers,

Elaine

This weeks featured community member is Anthony Chiboucas.
Tony is a savy, experienced PHP developer who lives and works in Portland, Oregon as a CMS developer at Downstream.
For the last 3 years, he has also been working on a graph-enabled middleware solution to connect artists, places, events, and genres throughout all history for museums and arts exhibitions.
That is, he has created a federated graph database of all arts for interactive museum exhibits.
He is in love with graphs, Cypher, and Neo4j since starting with that project and has not looked back.
He joined the Neo4j Community in 2019 and is active as a Neo4j Ninja in the Community Forum, Discord, Slack, and StackOverflow.
Tony enjoys answering many questions in our https://dev.neo4j.com/chat[Neo4j Discord Chat^] in almost all categories from Cypher to GDS and App development.
If you want to see Tony live, check out the https://youtu.be/hgyow2noyLw?t=14699[recording of the Pre-Nodes Show^] with Alex and Lju which features a lot of interesting guests of the Neo4j Community.

https://www.liquigraph.org/[Liquigraph^] is a database refactoring tool.
It helps you maintain your Neo4j database state by defining and incrementally executing migrations.
https://twitter.com/fbiville/[Florent Biville^], a Neo4j engineer, is the creator of liquigraph.
He has published a tool that will help you migrate from liquigraph to liquibase.
If you are using liquibase, consider helping to test this plugin.

== Following the Digital Breadcrumbs and Graphing the Blockchain

:tags: breadcrumbs, graphaware, blockchain

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210923074315/Breadcrumbs.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/graph_aware/[GraphAware^] and https://twitter.com/AppBreadcrumbs/[Breadcrumbs^] have teamed up to produce a Neo4j graph that helps users by visualizing block chain data.
The application they developed crunches 6 billion crypto transactions and organizes it in a way that their Breadcrumb tools can update and show data in a matter of seconds.

The folks at https://twitter.com/osinto/[Osinto^] provide knowledge graphs subscriptions to help you understand data around aviation and drones.
Their knowledge graphs are implemented with Neo4j on AWS.
In addition, they have Cloud Empire, their graph intelligence product that enables you to provide market insights, even with your own data.
In this demo, https://twitter.com/charlieosborne/[Charles Osborne^] shows how to explore the connections in a 3-D graph visualization. You can also try it yourself.

== Java 17: Explore the Newly-Released Java Version in a Graph Database!

:tags: java, modeling

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210923074326/Java17.jpeg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] has written an article about how she imported data for Java libraries through version 17.
She describes how she loaded the data and how she modeled the data so that questions could be answered about the differences between Java versions.

She used the data in the graph and Cypher to answer questions like these:

* What are the changes between any Java version (e.g. 8, 11, or 16) to 17?
* What has changed in the java.time package between version 16 and 17?
* What has been added/removed/etc in Java version 17?
