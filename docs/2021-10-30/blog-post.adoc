== Featured Community Member: Michela Ledwidge

Michela Ledwidge is the co-founder of Sydney based http://mod.studio/[studio "Mod"^] that specialises in realtime and virtual production.
Especially for investigating important topics like diversity, equity the studio uses modern ways of telling stories through data and visualization like AR and VR. 
For the "A Clever Label" production Neo4j has been used as backing database for correlating data of a investigative documentary for anti-LGBTQI interactions between Australian politicians, organizations, lobbyists.
The entities and connections served by a Web API from Neo4j and are visualized in VR usng Unreal Engine and can be explored and navigated interactively.
