Hello, everyone!

// introduction
It's week two of four for my run publishing TWIN4J.

Last week in the UK we enjoyed Bonfire Night, a night that I have found makes absolutely no sense outside of the UK.
On 5 November 1605, a man named Guy Fawkes was arrested while guarding explosives beneath the House of Lords in London.
He was part of a conspiracy to assassinate King James I and his parliament.

Ever since, on November 5, bonfires and fireworks have been lit to celebrate the foiling of the plot.
The tradition continues to this day.
I wonder what we would have made of the events nowadays.

But hey, any excuse for fireworks and marshmallows by an open fire!

On to this week's events in Neo4j, we've had another jam-packed week of content that I'm delighted to deliver to your inbox.
We take a look at a huge announcement for the company, take tackle rugby data, social graphs, predicting Mergers and Acquisitions and more.

Let's dive in!

In the past week there has been some huge news for Neo4j as a company!

As Emil outlines in link:https://neo4j.com/emil/welcome-patrick-pichette-to-neo4j-board/[this post on the Neo4j Blog^], we are delighted to welcome Patrick Pichette to the Neo4j Board of Directors as an independent board member.

Patrick is the former CFO of Google and serves as the Chairman of the Board of Twitter and Lightspeed.
In addition, he serves as an independent investor, advisor, and board member to a number of startups and innovation networks around the world.

// 3-4 paragraphs
As I've already mentioned, Grant Beasley has published two posts in a series on exploring Rugby Analytics in a Graph Database.

In the post, Grant uses Python to import XML data into Neo4j, creating a graph of Fixtures, Teams, Players and Referees.

Each fixture has a number of events attached to it, which Grant uses to analyse carries, tackles and more.

In link:https://twitter.com/OpenOwnership/status/1456583622702641155[Open Ownership's third technology showcase], Gavin Chait of Whythawk demonstrates how to import the Open Ownership dataset into Neo4j.

Gavin has also link:https://github.com/turukawa/coding-notes/blob/master/Open%20Ownership%20and%20Neo4j%20Setup.ipynb[published a Jupyter Notebook on Github] in which he demonstrates how to import the data and set up full-text indexes to query business entities.

// 3-4 paragraphs
Amr Saleh has published link:https://medium.com/javarevisited/implementing-facebook-social-graph-using-spring-and-neo4j-81c1b67351b7[a comprehensive article^] to Javarevisited on how to implement a Facebook style Social Graph using Spring and Neo4j.

This article builds on Amr's link:https://medium.com/javarevisited/microservices-in-practice-developing-instagram-clone-graph-service-193364c062df[previous post from June 2020^] where he used Neo4j and Spring Data Neo4j to build an Instagram clone.

Amr starts by explaining the graph structure, before diving into the code and creating Data objects, controllers and data repositories in Spring Data Neo4j.

You can link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIXjYJ0nPc4[watch a demo video for the project on Youtube^].
Show Amr some love by throwing him some claps on his Javarevisited article.

Following on from link:https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-in-neo4j-auradb-free-spark-connector-knime-integration/[last week's featured tweet], Tomaz has link:https://towardsdatascience.com/grand-sigmajs-c475ec0bde68[published an article on Towards Data Science] which goes into detail on _how_ he used GRANDStack and Sigma.js to visualise flight data.

The article teaches you to construct a Neo4j graph using data from link:https://openflights.org/[OpenFlights^], configure the Neo4j GraphQL library to serve the data, before finally demonstrating how to build a React application with Sigma.js to visualise the results.

The code is link:https://github.com/tomasonjo/grand-sigmaJS[available on Github^].

Yoann Maingon over at Ganister PLM has written a blog post on how they link:https://ganister.eu/blog/neo4j-browser-for-functional-visual-validation?lang=en[use Neo4j Browser for Functional Visual Validation^].
The post explains how link:https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/[Neo4j Browser^] allows Ganister PLM to visually make sense of their data.

They take advantage of the forced graph layout to visually represent their data, and use features in Neo4j Browser to change node sizes, relationship line thickness and colours.

My favorite quote from this post: _"Neo4j Browser to the Rescue!"_

// 3-4 paragraphs
link:https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01757[Over on arxiv.org^], Keenan Venuti has published a paper on Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions using Graph-based Deep Learning.

The goal of Keenan's work was to utilise link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/graph-sage/[GraphSAGE^], a popular graph machine learning framework, to predict mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of enterprise companies.

His results were promising.
The ML model was able to correctly predict a merger or aquisition with an 81.79% accuracy on the validation dataset.

If you are interested in learning more about GraphSAGE, then link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/graph-sage/[an implementation of GraphSAGE available in the Graph Data Science Libary^].

== Tweet of the Week

Finally, my favorite tweet this week comes from our very own Data Science Advocate, https://twitter.com/CJLovesData1[Clair Sullivan^].

As part of Clair's weekly series _"Bite-sized Neo4j for Data Scientists"_, she has published video #14 showing you how to run community detection algorithms on Neo4j using the Louvain method.
