  Michal's life is full of seeking knowledge and figuring out solutions on a lot of technical problems. He was always interested in technology and started with programming in young age.
  In the Neo4j graph world he worked on a PHP library that takes care of the low-level details of connectivity with Neo4j. The project is now the foundation of the new PHP driver, which in turn will allow the whole PHP ecosystem to work with recent Neo4j versions again! For this he was awarded the <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/the-results-are-in-here-are-this-years-graphie-award-winners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neo4j Graphie Award 2021</a>. Congratulations Michal!</p>

  <p>Neo4j Bloom, our beautiful and expressive data visualization tool that freely interacts with Neo4j’s graph data platform with no code – has been delighting users since its initial release in 2018. Three years later, Bloom 2.0 has arrived with some key feature updates we think you’ll find helpful in your graph data exploration:
  <ul>
    <li>Scene Saving: Save multiple scenes, preserving all layout and styling details for later use</li>
    <li>Scene Sharing: Collaborate with colleagues by sharing a read-only scene</li>
    <li>Histogram: Easily apply styling rules and filters for your ad-hoc exploration workflows</li>
    <li>Improved SSO Capability: Enable SSO in your corporate environment</li>
    <li>Improved Editing Support: Leverage Bloom’s codeless interface to edit data ad-hoc</li>

  <p>Véronique Gendner from Univ Gustave Eiffel presents the Choucas research project which collects methods, tools and resources, to help mountain rescue team localise victims, when answering emergency calls. In this context, they have built a Neo4j graph, that integrates several sources of geolocated objects. Some data comes from the national mapping agency (IGN BDTOPO), others, like routes from crowdsourcing websites. </p>

  <p>
  In this tutorial Chris Hay looks at how to use Neo4j for digital forensics. He looks at how you can build a digital document fingerprint and how that could be represented in Neo4j as a graph and how the the graph database can establish links between various pdf documents. He also analyzes other documents such as the Adam Back hashcash paper as well as another document created by Craig Wright to establish fingerprints of his document creation software.
