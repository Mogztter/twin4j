// featured community member(s) presentation
This week's featured community member is Emre Varol.
Emre is a Data Scientist based in Istanbul, Turkey.  He works for John Snow labs, a company that focusses on AI and NLP solutions for healthcare companies.

Emre presented at the Neo4j Healthcare & Life Sciences Workshop last week, walking through how he created a Clinical Knowledge Graph using Spark NLP and Neo4j.
The presentation starts by introducing Spark NLP and how it can be used within the Healthcare space, before providing a life demo in which Emre walks through Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract information from text, and imports it into a link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j Sandbox^] instance.

// 3-4 paragraphs
As part of Cloudflare's Full Stack Week Developer Speaker Series, link:https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] gave a talk on how to improve News recommendations using Knowledge Graphs and Cloudflare workers.
Will's 30 minute talk focuses on the term an article based Knowledge Graph using data from the NY Times API including news articles, associated meta-data and comments.

He then uses Cloudflare Workers to serve a real-time recommendation engine which takes into account the user's loation and interests.

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless application platform  that runs on Cloudflare's global cloud network.
They aim to solve many of the common problems with existing serverless technologies, including performance issues and the cold-start problem.
Cloudflare Workers are also location aware, making them ideal for location-based personalisation.

The link:https://dev.neo4j.com/news-graph[slides^] and link:https://github.com/johnymontana/news-graph[code^] are also available online.

// 3-4 paragraphs
Over on the link:https://medium.com/neo4j[the Neo4j Developer Blog^], Shaani Arya Srivastava has published an interesting article on how graphs may be a solution for the affects of climate change on our planet.

Shaani's article looks at identifying industries and cities that are responsible for pollution by linking them with their respective areaâ€™s air/water quality measures and disease case.

With COP26 ending last week, this is a topic that I'm sure is on the mind of many people at the moment.

// 3-4 paragraphs
Also from the link:https://medium.com/neo4j[the Neo4j Developer Blog^], Michael Hunger has written an article to accompany Week 13 of the Discover AuraDB Free weekly stream on the link:https://twitch.tv/neo4j[Neo4j Twitch channel].

In the post, Michael explores th **IBM Attrition Dataset**, which consists of employee information, along with their job satisfaction rating and a set of attributes that contribute towards that rating.

Michael starts off by importing the data using LOAD CSV, creating a Graph of employees, jobs, departments and education data.
The article concludes with suggestions for how you could use Neo4j and the Graph Data Science library to predict attrition rates.

// 3-4 paragraphs
Over at Know-BI, an article has been published on how to import data into Neo4j using Apache Hop.
Apache Hop is a data engineering and data orchestration platform that allows data engineers and data developers to visually design workflows and pipelines to build powerful solutions.
It offers a comprehensive feature set for getting data into, and extracting data out of Neo4j.

The article demonstrates how Apache Hop's User Interface can be used to configure a Neo4j connection, create pipelines for transforming CSV data and output the data to a Neo4j.
All of this can be achieved without writing a line of code!

// 3-4 paragraphs
This week's research paper comes from page 825 of _Science Vol. 362_, where Samuel P Faiberger _et al._ examine 500k artists and determines that their long-term success can be attributed to they are connected.
The study uses an extensive record of exhibition and auction data to study the career trajectory of individual artists relative to a nwtwork of galleries and museums.

Spoiler alert: it turns out it is hard to break into the world of art if you do not start off with the right connections.

== Tweet of the Week

There has been some link:https://twitter.com/neo4j[great content on #neo4j hashtag^] this week, link:https://twitter.com/padonouDD/status/1458047261452161030[@padonouDD has been taking his first steps with Cypher^] and link:https://twitter.com/mikesir87/status/1458450340043493378[@mikesir87 has been experimenting with Docker container image data^].

But favorite tweet this week has to be https://twitter.com/SavvasStephnds[Savvas Stephanides^]'s awesome thread introducing the high level concepts around Graph Databases.
