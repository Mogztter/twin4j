Hello, everyone!

üéÉ  Is it just me or is this month getting just getting spookier and spookier by the day? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just me, but it still doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs been spooked this month. At least not if you‚Äôve been working at Twitch.

üì∫  Twitch made an "oopsie" and now their source code is all over https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712365/twitch-data-leak-breach-security-confirmation-comments[the internet].  We did not have partaken in this "oopsie", but we‚Äôve been working on a new Twitch dataset you can use to analyze streamer data in this issue.

‚ö†Ô∏è There is also a new Stack Overflow dataset to explore in this issue.

üç∫  For those of you who like beer, we‚Äôve got a beer feature for you in this issue, and how a certain individual makes his own beer recommendation engine, if that is not a great use of graphs then I don‚Äôt know what is.

Furthermore, we feature Graphaule a podcast/article series that focuses on graph value and how to bring these concepts together for value creation and we also feature some hands-on experiences within health care & life science, as well as a masterclass in knowledge graphs.

Another cool thing is that you can still get a t-shirt for free when you certify as a Neo4j Certified Professional. 
That‚Äôs it for me this week. Have great week and see you next week again.
Cheers üçª , Max Andersson

I don't know about you, but I do occationally endulge in a beer after work, but Bart Simons decided to take a break from drinking beer to scrape the  beer tracking app Untapped, in order to create his very own beer recommendation engine. Cheers!

Bart Simons is a data scientist at a major consultancy firm. He created a beer recommendation engine using data from the Untappd app. He scraped data about people‚Äôs preferences, social networks, and visits to venues. Using the data, he created a graph database and created a recommendation function. He then created a score based on the similarity of beer users' ratings. The project is a work in progress, but working on putting the scraper in a script form instead of a command-line.

Khuyen Tran uses Neo4j to find the similarities between artificial intelligence companies. The data is being made available with the public domain CC0 license with the help of Diffbot's knowledge graph. The graph is then being used to find the most similar companies.

== üì∫  Twitch Sandbox
:tags: neo4j, twitch, sandbox, dataset, streamers


Twitch is a streaming service that allows users to watch live video feeds and chat with other users. Mainly focues on gaming, they provide a plaform for sharing content of all kinds. In this dataset you can explore the data from originally scraped from Twitch. Using the data you can explore the streamers and their streams, what games they are plaing, and how they are interacting with each other.

If you ever dealt with code, no matter how small, you've probably seen  Stack Overflow. It's a website that allows users to ask questions and answer them. Discover Questions, Answers, Comments, and Tags from Stack Overflow in a graph database.

Stefan Wendin & Rik Van Bruggen are going to go on a quest together to better understand the value of graphs. The destination is "Graphalue" (pronounced gr…ëÀêf√¶ljuÀê or grAfAl-yoo) A reference to the mythical land that brings the value concept together with the technical concepts of graphs. This quest is not going to be too long, but not too short either. Thinking this through, together, and creating a number of articles and podcasts about this topic on the way.

== Masterclass of the Knowledge Graphs

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20211015093805/clair.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

The goal of this masterclass is to take participants from raw, unstructured text into the creation of a full knowledge graph. Participants will learn how to use basic natural language processing (NLP) to construct a small knowledge graph using Python and a graph database. From here, we will explore techniques around creating graph embeddings as the entry point for binary classification problems for node classification. Queries will be demonstrated using the Cypher Query Language, both from within the Neo4j web browser as well as from Python in the notebook environment.
