== Tutorial: Getting Started with Graph Embeddings in Neo4j

++++

https://twitter.com/cjlovesdata1[Clair Sullivan^] has just published a tutorial to get you started with graph embeddings with the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library.
The starting point for all machine learning is to turn your data into vectors/embeddings.
Clair shows you how to use graph embeddings to turn your graph data into vectors that can be tuned for your machine learning process.
You can do all of this with a Neo4j Sandbox so that you need not install anything on your system.
In the tutorial, she goes into the algorithms used for the different types of embeddings you can create.

</div>

Our colleague, https://twitter.com/biggus_data[Alex Woolford^] has published an article that explains how data that passes through Confluent Cloud can also be passed into a Neo4j Cloud instance, Aura.
More and more enterprises are choosing to use managed services such as Confluent Cloud and Neo4j Aura which unburden them from needing to manage and maintain the hosting servides.
He shows a simple example of how to stream Confluent events into Neo4j where he uses a set of technologies which include Kafka, Python, Docker, REST API, and of course Cypher.

https://twitter.com/fishnets88[Vincent D. Warmerdam^] has an impressive Web site for learning called https://calmcode.io/index.html/[Code. Simply. Calmly. Clearly.]
This site is a collection of 74 video courses on a variety of technical topics.
One of the courses teaches you how to get started with Neo4j Desktop and import CSV data into Neo4j.
It is a great course to go through if you want a simple introduction to Cypher.

https://twitter.com/BryantAvey[Bryant Avey^], posted a tutorial that steps you through importing data from a graph to Power BI. It covers how to use the default version of the Neo4j HTTP API with Power BI. Utilizing the Web API method allows all queries written for the REST API to be utilized in Power BIâ€™s online service.

https://twitter.com/datafitter[datafitter^], from https://datafitter.com/[Data Fitter^] posted an article that describes how they used Neo4j, Machine Learning, and GraphQL to help with their analysis of carbohydrate genomes. Even if you know nothing about carbohydrate genomes, you can learn how these technologies can help you to make conclusions about complex data.

Last year, at NODES, https://twitter.com/OnSoftware[Vladimir Bacvanski^] and https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakmc[Deepak Chandramoul], from PayPal presented this session where introduced us to how they build their application to combine data from many sources and used Gimel, Spark, and Kafka to stream data into Neo4j for analysis. They shared how they architected their application, as well as the GitHub repo that contains their work. Graph Algorithms and GraphQL also played an important role in their application.

We hope that you will or have registered for NODES 2021. The week before our online conference, we will host 2-hour, hands-on training sessions led by our Developer Relations team members. You do not have to register for the training sessions as your registration for NODES 2021 will allow you to attend these sessions.

The sessions will take place every day at 9:00AM EST | 1:00PM UTC | 6:30PM IST.

Here are the sessions you can attend:

* Mon., June 7: _Hands-on Introduction to Neo4j_ with Ljubica Lazarevic
* Tue.,  June 8: _Hands-on with Neo4j Aura Free Tier_ with Jennifer Reif
* Wed., June 9: _Getting started with Neo4j Bloom_ with Ljubica Lazarevic
* Thu., June 10: _Building GraphQL APIs With The Neo4j GraphQL Library_ with William Lyon
* Fri., June 11: _Creating a Knowledge Graph with Neo4j: A Simple Machine Learning Approach_ with Clair Sullivan

We will be posting instructions to prepare your environment for each session. You will need a laptop/PC for the sessions. An iPad/Chromebook will not work.
