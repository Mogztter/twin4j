Hello, everyone!

Don't miss our free hands-on training sessions (~2 hours each day) June 7-11.
All folks who register for NODES can attend these sessions (scroll down for details).

In this week's episode, we thank Alberto De Lazzari for his contributions to Neo4j.
One of our Data Scientist colleagues, Clair Sullivan has posted an easy-to-follow tutorial about getting started with Graph Embeddings.
A Neo4j field engineer, Alex Wolford posted an article about using Confluent with Neo4j Aura.
We have discovered a Web site, _Code. Simply. Calmly. Clearly._ that features video courses, one of which introduces you to Neo4j, Cypher, and importing data.
The folks at Liquibase have just enhanced their products to work with Neo4j to help you with managing a Neo4j database from development to production.
Our Cloud Architect, David Allen was interviewed by the folks at the Data Stack Show where he describes everything you would want to know about making the decision to use Neo4j for your application.
And finally, we pull from our library of NODES 2020 videos of a presentation about modeling processes in the automotive industry.

Cheers,

== Tutorial: Getting Started with Graph Embeddings in Neo4j

https://twitter.com/cjlovesdata1[Clair Sullivan^] has just published a tutorial to get you started with graph embeddings with the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library.
The starting point for all machine learning is to turn your data into vectors/embeddings.
Clair shows you how to use graph embeddings to turn your graph data into vectors that can be tuned for your machine learning process.
You can do all of this with a Neo4j Sandbox so that you need not install anything on your system.
In the tutorial, she goes into the algorithms used for the different types of embeddings you can create.

Our colleague, https://twitter.com/biggus_data[Alex Woolford^] has published an article that explains how data that passes through Confluent Cloud can also be passed into a Neo4j Cloud instance, Aura.
More and more enterprises are choosing to use managed services such as Confluent Cloud and Neo4j Aura which unburden them from needing to manage and maintain the hosting services.
He shows a simple example of how to stream Confluent events into Neo4j where he uses a set of technologies which include Kafka, Python, Docker, REST API, and, of course, Cypher.

https://twitter.com/fishnets88[Vincent D. Warmerdam^] has an impressive Web site for learning called https://calmcode.io/index.html/[Code. Simply. Calmly. Clearly.]
This site is a collection of 74 video courses on a variety of technical topics.
One of the courses teaches you how to get started with Neo4j Desktop and import CSV data into Neo4j.
It is a great course to go through if you want a simple introduction to Cypher.

https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^], along with Kostas Pardalis and Eric Dodds, hosts of the https://datastackshow.com/[Data Stack Show^] had an hour-long discussion about Neo4j.
In this podcast, David educates us about what Neo4j is, why a graph database is important, some tidbits about how Neo4j works under the covers, how Neo4j can scale, and how Neo4j can be used to work with event streams.
