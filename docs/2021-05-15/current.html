<p>Hello, everyone!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this week&#8217;s episode, Tomaz Bratanic  teaches you how to visualize graph embedding algorithm results in NEuler. Luc Michalski has developed a Reddit Detective Python application that can be used to discover potentially problematic data in Reddit. Dirk Mahler has developed the jQAssistant application where Neo4j helps to identify problems in your software architecture. Paul Parkinson from Oracle published a blog that shows how to use Neo4j as a datasource in a Helidon Microservice. Rebecca Rabb posted a blog about how graph data models are necessary for corporate data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, we have included a link to the <em>Advanced Query Tuning</em> training session that Mark Quinsland presented last year.</p>

<p>Cheers,

<p>Chris has developed and architected applications for IBM and has discovered Neo4j.  He has created this excellent 30 minute video to get you started using Neo4j. In the video, he shows how easy it is to download and create a Docker instance of Neo4j. He steps you through how to create nodes, relationships , and properties in the graph, as well executing queries. Then, he goes further by showing you how easy it is to create a data model in Neo4j that supports a software supply-chain application. You can definitely use some of the points in this video to imagine how you could model a financial application where fraud detection is necessary. We like how Chris shows how easy it is to get started modeling your data with Neo4j.</p>

<p>Thank you Chris for creating such a great video!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomaz Bratanic</a>  published a tutorial that teaches you how to execute and visualize graph embedding algorithm results in Neo4j&#8217;s  Graph Data Science Playground application, NEuler. NEuler is an excellent tool for data scientists that can be used with <a href="https://neo4j.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo4j Desktop</a> or a <a href="https://sandbox.neo4j.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo4j Sandbox</a>. In this tutorial, he steps you through loading the data through visualizing graph embedding results with the t-SNE scatter plot.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lucmichalski" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luc Michalski</a> created a Python application that loads a graph with Reddit data and enables you to look for political disinformation campaigns, secret influences, and more.  With this application, you can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist ">

<ul>
<li>Detect political disinformation campaigns.</li>
<li>Find trolls manipulating the discussion.</li>
<li>Find secret influencers and idea spreaders (it might be you!).</li>
<li>Detect "cyborg-like" activities.</li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dirkmahler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dirk Mahler</a> and a group of other developers have been working on an open-source project called JQAssistant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>jQAssistant is a QA tool, which allows the definition and validation of project specific rules on a structural level. It is built upon the graph database Neo4j and can easily be plugged into the build process to automate detection of constraint violations and generate reports about user defined concepts and metrics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example use cases include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist ">

<ul>
<li>Enforce naming conventions, e.g. EJBs, JPA entities, test classes, packages, Maven modules etc.</li>
<li>Validate dependencies between modules of your project</li>
<li>Separate API and implementation packages</li>
<li>Detect common problems like cyclic dependencies or tests without assertions</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consultant Rebecca Rabb for <a href="https://www.graphable.ai/">Graphable.io</a>, posted this blog which describes how corporate data is much better served from a graph database, rather than other types of databases.  Companies execute their business operations because of their connections to other companies. The only way to reasonably represent these connections is a graph. Rebecca presents two different use cases where graphs are the best solution. You can follow Graphable at <a href="https://twitter.com/Graphable1">@Graphable1</a></p>
