Hello, everyone!

We hope that some of you were able to attend the hands-on training sessions that the developer relations team members conducted last week.
We had a great turnout for these sessions which were recorded.

This week we feature Bryant Avey who has worked on many projects that use Neo4j, particularly around integration with business processes.
Kineviz has a new portal where you can use GraphXR for visualization of your data without needing to install anything.
Sixing Huang, a data scientist describes how he explored the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) using Neo4j.
Lju Lazaravic published a tutorial about relational vs. graph data modeling and how the Movie data is accessed using Cypher vs. SQL.
Charlotte Skardon posted some tips for how to use Neo4j from Azure by using Dependency Injection for reusing the driver instance.
Jennifer Reif published part 2 of her blog series about migrating from Neo4j Spring Data 5 to Neo4j Spring Data 6.
David Allen tweeted a thread, a how-to guide for easily importing JSON into Neo4j using the APOC library.
And finally, we share a *huge* set of videos that were presented by the Neo4j Developer Relations team on many topics.

We hope you enjoy this weeks news.

Cheers,

Elaine

== Exploring Neo4j Sandbox & GraphXR

:tags: sandbox, data-visualization, graphxr, kineviz

The https://community.kineviz.com/[Kineviz Community^] has created a hands-on tutorial that instructs you to create a visualization of your data using GraphXR.
The steps of the tutorial show you how to use the graph in a Neo4j Sandbox and visualize it.
You need not install anything on your system to create the visualization.
Then, if you are impressed with the visualization you have created, you can add it to the Kineviz GraphXR Gallery for others to see.

== Neo4j for Antibiotic Resistance

https://linkedin.com/in/sixing-huang-3a824a66/[Sixing Huang], a data scientist who is a Certified Neo4j Professional and is also certified in Neo4j Graph Data Science has written an article about the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)  work he has done.
In this article, he explains how to load the data into a Neo4j graph.
He then uses Neo4j Bloom to explore the data.
The article shows a number of Cypher queries that can be used to understand the data and answer questions about the data.

== Answering Frequent Questions: Relational vs Graph

https://twitter.com/ellazal/[Lju Lazaravic^] wrote a tutorial that explains how to model relational data as a Neo4j graph.
It is a beginners guide to understanding the property graph model implemented by Neo4j, especially when coming from a relational background.
In this guide Lju compares how data is modeled in relational vs. Neo4j's property graph model.
She introduces you to the Movie graph that is used for learning Cypher and compares how queries are done with Cypher and how they would be done in SQL.
It is definitely a good read for those who have worked with relational and need a jump-start for understanding Neo4j and Cyher.

== Azure Functions, Neo4j and Dependency Injection

:tags: azure,dependency,injection, functions

https://twitter.com/CSkardon[Charlotte Skardon^] has written another post about Azure functions. In Visual Studio, a function is instantiated, run, and then it is deleted.
The creation of the driver instance repeatedly is not performant. Charlotte describes in this post how to reuse the driver in your code using Dependency Injection(DI).
Reusing the driver instance enables you to send many Cypher queries to the Neo4j database without additional overhead.

https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] has written Part 2 of her articles on migrating Spring Data Neo4j.
This article steps you through how to use the migration Github repo for your migration.
It uses a Spring Data Neo4j 5 application with OGM and upgrades to the dependencies and syntax changes of Spring Data Neo4j 6.
This application uses the imperative style code. Her next post in this series will cover reactive functionality.

https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] posted a quick and easy how-to guide for loading JSON data into a Neo4j graph.
He uses the @TheHackersNews public API to load a mini-feed of stories.
He shows how to transform the data so that it can be loaded with APOC library calls.
