Hello, everyone!

We hope that some of you were able to attend the hands-on training sessions that the developer relations team members conducted last week.
We had a great turnout for these sessions.

This week we feature Bryan Avey who has worked on many projects that use Neo4j.

This week's featured community member is https://twitter.com/bryantavey/[Bryant Avey^]Bryant Avey.
He is the Chief Geek and CIO of InterNuntius, Inc. where he has used his expertise to integrate Neo4j with business systems.
In addition, he serves as the Chief Data Officer of a non-profit, Stratalytica that promotes open data and knowledge graphs used by many organizations.

He has written these interesting Medium articles:

== Exploring Neo4j Sandbox & GraphXR

:tags: sandbox, data-visualization, graphxr, kineviz

The https://community.kineviz.com/[Kineviz Community^] has created a hands-on tutorial that instructs you to create a visualization of your data using GraphXR.
The steps of the tutorial show you how to use the graph in a Neo4j Sandbox and visualize it.
You need not install anything on your system to create the visualization.
Then, if you are impressed with the visualization you have created, you can add it to the Kineviz GraphXR Gallery for others to see.

== Neo4j for Antibiotic Resistance

linkedin.com/in/sixing-huang-3a824a66/[Sixing Huang], a data scientist who is a Certified Neo4j Professional and is also certified in Neo4j Graph Data Science has written an article about the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)  work he has done.
In this article, he explains how to load the data into a Neo4j graph.
He then uses Neo4j Bloom to explore the data.
The article shows a number of Cypher queries that can be used to understand the data and answer questions about the data.

== Answering Frequent Questions: Relational vs Graph

:tags: relational, graph, modeling, graphdatabase, cypher, sql

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/xyz/lju-codecamp.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/ellazal/[Lju Lazaravic^] wrote a tutorial that explains how to model relational data as a Neo4j graph.
It is a beginners guide to understanding the property graph model implemented by Neo4j, especially when coming from a relational background.
In this guide Lju compares how data is modeled in relational vs. Neo4j's property graph model.
She introduces you to the Movie graph that is used for learning Cypher and compares how queries are done with Cypher and how they would be done in SQL.
It is definitely a good read for those who have worked with relational and need a jump-start for understanding Neo4j and Cyher.

== Azure Functions, Neo4j and Dependency Injection

:tags: azure,dependency,injection

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/xyz/AzureFunctions-charlotte.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/CSkardon[Charlotte Skardon^] has written another post about Azure functions. In VS, a function is instantiated, run, and then it is deleted.
The creation of the driver instance repeatedly is not performant. Charlotte describes in this post how to reuse the driver in your code using Dependency Injection(DI).
Reusing the driver instance enables you to send many Cypher queries to the Neo4j database without additional overhead.

== Winter to Spring: Migrating from Spring Data Neo4j 5 to 6, Part 2

:tags: spring, migrate

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/xyz/spring-migrate.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/jmhreif[Jennifer Reif^] has written Part 2 of her articles on migrating Spring Data Neo4j.
This article steps you through how to use the migration Github repo for your migration.
It uses a Spring Data Neo4j 5 application with OGM and upgrades to the dependencies and syntax changes of Spring Data Neo4j 6.
This application uses the imperative style code. Her next post in this series will cover reactive functionality.

https://twitter.com/mdavidallen[David Allen^] posted a quick and easy how-to guide for loading JSON data into a Neo4j graph.
He uses the @TheHackersNews public API to load a mini-feed of stories.
He shows how to transform the data so that it can be loaded with APOC library calls.
