== Viewing Google deps.dev data

Our own https://twitter.com/mesirii/[Michael Hunger^] shows us how easy it is to take advantage of the new Google tool, https://deps.dev/[deps.dev^],
that provides dependencies for maven, npm, cargo and pypi. He used the this tool to load the dependencies of https://deps.dev/maven/org.neo4j:neo4j-kernel[neo4j-kernel^]
and then was able to visualize it in Neo4j Bloom. The helper files can be found in this https://gist.github.com/jexp/9541bbfc17e0383d1e55388a7d7e3162/[gist^] Really cool!

== neo-forgery: Mock a Neo4j driver session

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/xyz/npm_mock.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/YisroelYakovson/[Yisroel Yakovson^] just published an npm package, neo-forgery.
This package enables you to simulate neo4j drivers so you can unit-test your application.
It is fast and can be used with CLI and TDD.
You can specify configuration parameters that can be used for your unit tests.
When the application changes, it can be easily retested.
You can even use it on a real database to confirm that your test queries still work.
