== Viewing Google deps.dev data

Our own https://twitter.com/mesirii/[Michael Hunger^] shows us how easy it is to take advantage of the new Google tool, https://deps.dev/[deps.dev^],
that provides dependencies for maven, npm, cargo and pypi. He used the this tool to load the dependencies of https://deps.dev/maven/org.neo4j:neo4j-kernel[neo4j-kernel^]
and then was able to visualize it in Neo4j Bloom. The helper files can be found in this https://gist.github.com/jexp/9541bbfc17e0383d1e55388a7d7e3162/[gist^] Really cool!

== neo-forgery: A Mock a Neo4j driver session

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210610130815/npm_mock.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/YisroelYakovson/[Yisroel Yakovson^] just published an npm package, neo-forgery.
This package enables you to simulate neo4j drivers so you can unit-test your application.
It is fast and can be used with CLI and TDD.
You can specify configuration parameters that can be used for your unit tests.
When the application changes, it can be easily retested.
You can even use it on a real database to confirm that your test queries still work.

== Motherlode: How to Create a Heterogeneous Neo4j Data Loading Pipeline Framework (Fast)

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210610130812/motherlode_tim_bleimehl.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbleimehl/[Tim Bleimehl^] who has worked extensively on the
CovidGraph project and for the German Center for Diabetes Research has posted an article about
creating a  heterogeneous Neo4j data loading pipeline.
This article first describes the challenges of collecting data from multiple sources and why
the coordination of resources for something like CovidGraph motivated their development.
The tool, called Motherlode, is like a docker-compose with the added benefit of loading data into Neo4j.

== tei2neo: Parser to extract information and store it in a Neo4j database

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210610130802/TEI-Julien_Raemy.jpeg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/julsraemy/[Julian Raemy^] described some of the details of a project at https://twitter.com/USI_university[USI University^].
They used https://pypi.org/project/tei2neo/[tei2neo^] to parse the _Semper Edition_ to load a graph
where text is stored as chains of nodes and relations and represent words, parts of words or punctuation marks.
Nodes have properties and labels and are linked together to represent direction of text flow.
_tei2neo_ takes TEI-XML documents and uses a combination of _Beautiful Soup4_ and _Spacy_ to parse the document.

== Neo4j RBAC with Azure Active Directory

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210610130758/RBAC_AzureAD.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/SohamDhodapkar/[Soham Dhodapkar^] from Neo4j has posted this blog with step-by-step instructions
to configure and use Neo4j's RBAC functionality with Azure Active Directory Domain Services.
He details the configuration necessary on the Azure Active Directory Data Service component and then to use RBAC in Neo4j.

== Monitor Neo4j with Prometheus and Grafana

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210610130754/Prometheus_alex_woolford.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/biggus_data/[Alex Woolford^] from Neo4j published yet another blog about monitoring Neo4j.
He teaches you how to install and set up Prometheus for monitoring.
Once it is connected to your Neo4j instance you can use Grafana to create your monitoring dashboards.

In the run-up to NODES 2021 (the Neo4j Online Developer Expo & Summit) https://twitter.com/ElLazal/[Lju Lazarevic^] and https://twitter.com/lyonwj/[William Lyon^] interviewed a few of the speakers to tell us how they first got excited about graphs, what they're working on, and give us a preview of what they'll be sharing at NODES 2021.
