In this week's #twin4j, we highlight Alexios Pantavos as our valued community member. Graphileon and Graphlytic demonstrate some new features of their tools. Clair will teach a KG course. We point to some interesting analyses of twitter and numeric graphs. We also describe the Aura/Kafka integration.
And finally Jennifer describes Reactive Programming with Neo4j Spring Data.
