Hello, everyone!

I hope that you are having a great summer and that you can take some time to refresh yourselves.
In spite of the summer hiatus, many folks have been busy doing Neo4j-related work!

This week, we highlight Rajesh Gaddipati and Vishal Kachave as our featured community members.
They presented at the API Summit 2021 conference about how they used the GraphQL API and Neo4j in their work at Fujitsu.

Lju Lazaravic and Alex Erdl from Neo4j have begun a weekly series where they step through how to model a particular dataset and create a graph in Aura Free.
Will Lyon has again posted an interesting tutorial. His latest is about building a GraphQL Server with Next.js and Vercel.
Marco Del Coco from GraphAware describes how he used Hume to create an image recognition application.
Tomaz Bratanic describes how he uses both the Neo4j Data Science Library and KarateClub to create node embeddings for graph analysis.
And finally, Michael Simons from Neo4j points us to a migration tool that can  be used to migrate applications with embedded Neo4j.

== Featured Community Members: Rajesh Gaddipati & Vishal Kachave

This week's featured community members are Rajesh Gaddipati and Vishal Kachave. They collaborated recently on a session for API Summit 2021 where they presented how they used GraphQL and Neo4j.

Rajesh is very active in the Twitter Community and has actively followed and retweeted posts related to Neo4j, NODES 2021, and GraphQL.
Thank you Rajesh for your enthusiasm and support!
Rajesh is also a Certified Neo4j Professional.
He uses his Neo4j and GraphQl expertise to develop applications for Fujitsu where he leads the Graph Analytics stack.

Vishal has developed GraphQL applications that use Angular and React JS, as well as GraphQL and Neo4j at Fujitsu.
He is part of the Centre for Emerging Technologies team at Fujitsu.

== Talk: API Summit 2021 - GraphQL and Neo4j

Rajesh Gaddipati and Vishal Kachave presented at API Summit 2021 on "The Role of GraphQL in Emerging Technologies".

They compared graph databases with relational databases, demonstrated a REST API, and compared it with a GraphQL API, explaining the differences and the benefits of each approach.

Then they introduced and demonstrated using the Neo4j GraphQL library providing an API for inserting and serving the conference data using Neo4j Aura Free as a back-end database.
Using that data, they ran some advanced queries on top of the last 5 years of conference data to show the power of a graph using Neo4j Browser and Bloom.

My colleagues here at Neo4j, https://twitter.com/ellazal/[Lju Lazaravic^] and https://twitter.com/alexandererdl/[Alex Erdl^], have started a weekly live-streaming event that will occur on Momdays.
Every week, they will hold a session that shows you how to model and load a particular dataset into a Neo4j Aura Free instance.
The sessions typically last for an hour and will be posted https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/discoveraurafree/[here^].

For this week's dataset, they show you how to model and create a graph with the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) data that is publicly available from the https://fivethirtyeight.com/[FiveThirtyEight] site.

== Building A GraphQL Server with Next.js

Next.js is an awesome React framework, but did you know you can use it to build backend API endpoints?
Our wonderful GraphQL expert, https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] wrote a tutorial (with video!) on how to use nextjs API routes to build a GraphQL API with Neo4j Aura.
In the tutorial, he also shows you to deploy it as a serverless function with https://vercel.com/[vercel^].

== Graph-based Image Recognition in Hume

https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-del-coco-7b751b3a/[Marco Del Coco^] from https://graphaware.com/[GraphAware] just published a blog about using Hume for an image recognition application.
In his application, he uses three Hume orchestra workflows to create the knowledge graph.
He uses image processing and clustering back-end services to provide useful views of subjects co-occurrences, pictures and subject visualization and maps, and time perspectives.

== Integrate Neo4j with KarateClub Node Embedding Package
:tags: neo4j, graph-embedding, KarateClub, data-science

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210729101536/KarateClub.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz?lang=en[Tomaz Bratanic^] has recently posted a blog that describes how he used node embeddings to analyze the Harry Potter Universe data.
To quote Tomaz: "Node embeddings are helpful when you want to capture network information in a fixed-size vector and use it in a downstream Machine Learning workflow."

In this blog he uses the KarateClub API to help him to create a NetworkX graph that is stored in Neo4j.
He then uses a number of graph algorithms both in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library  and the KarateClub library to create the embeddings used to analyze the data.

In addition, he shares a https://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/harry_potter/Harry_Potter_Karate_Club_integration.ipynb/[collab notebook^] so you can try the algorithms yourself.

== Neo4j Instance Migration
:tags: neo4j, migration, maven, java

https://twitter.com/rotnroll666[Michael Simons^], a Neo4j engineer has just released tooling for migrating a Neo4j instance that is embedded in your Java application.

This is a tool for defining Java based migrations that should be applied and recorded against a Neo4j instance.
The only dependencies are the Neo4j Java driver and ClassGraph, the later being used to find migrations on the classpath.

Neo4j Migrations is inspired by https://flywaydb.org/[FlywayDB^], which is an awesome tool for migration of relational databases.
