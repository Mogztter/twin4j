Rajesh Gaddipati and Vishal Kachave did a presentation at API Summit 2021 on "The role of GraphQL in emerging technologies".

They compared Graph Databases with relational databases, demonstrated a REST API, and compared it with a GraphQL API explaining the differences and the benefits of each approach.

Then they introduced and demoed the Neo4j/GraphQL library providing an API for inserting and serving the conference data using Neo4j Aura Free as a back-end database.
Using that data, they ran some advanced queries on top of the last 5 years of conference data to show the power of a graph using Neo4j Browser and Bloom.

My colleagues in Developer Relations, https://twitter.com/ellazal/[Lju Lazaravic^] and https://twitter.com/alexandererdl/[Alex Erdl^], have started a new live-streaming event that will occur on Momdays.
Every week, they will hold a session that shows you how to model and load the data into a Neo4j Aura Free instance.
The sessions typically last for an hour and will be posted https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/discoveraurafree/[here^].
Every week, Lju and Alex will show you how to model a different dataset.

For this week's stream, they show you how to model and create a graph with the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) data that is publicly available from the https://fivethirtyeight.com/[FiveThirtyEight] site.

Next.js is an awesome React framework, but did you know you can use it to build backend API endpoints?
https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] wrote a tutorial (with video!) on how to use #nextjs API routes to build a GraphQL API with @neo4j Aura & deploy as a serverless function w/ @vercel.
