Hey everyone!

I'm Adam and I work on the education side of our Dev Rel team, namely our link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com[GraphAcademy^] platform.

I don't know about you, but I always find the week where the clocks fall back in Europe plays havoc with my schedule, especially with the regular meetings arranged by my colleagues over in the US.

For the next month, I will be trawling through the archives to bring you some of the more interesting articles written by our fantastic community members.

We start off with some big announcements from Neo4j related to link:https://neo4j.com/aura[Neo4j Aura] and the Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark.
Tomaz Bratanic also gives us an overview of the new Twitch dataset to Neo4j Sandbox.

We also have posts from Josip Almasi on his Open Source VR Server built on Neo4j, an introduction to the Neo4j Integration for KNIME, and finally Rik Van Bruggen and Stefan Wendin.

I hope you enjoy reading these articles as much as I have.

// 3-4 paragraphs
As this is my first week, I thought I would take this opportunity to shamelessly plug what I have personally been working on for the past few months.
You may have already read link:https://medium.com/neo4j/introducing-the-new-graphacademy-45b0df491a23[my blog post introducing the new GraphAcademy site^], but if not I would like to spend a paragraph or two on our new set of courses.

We have tried to focus on your journey as a Neo4j professional and provide you a clear path to a link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/categories/certification/[Neo4j Certification^].


1. The link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] course is designed to give anyone a high-level understanding of what graphs are and where neo4j fits in your tech stack.
2. One you know what graphs are useful for, you can progress to the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course to learn how to get data out of the graph. The course is hands-on, constantly challenging you as you go.
3. The link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals^] course will then provide you with the techniques required to create and refactor your data model for performance.

The Cypher Fundamentals and Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals courses are both give you some hands-on experience using link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/[Neo4j Sandbox^] instances.

I hope you enjoy them.  If you have any feedback, Please feel free to reach out by replying to this email or emailing graphacademy@neo4j.com.
Or alternatively, you can use the feedback forms embedded in to every lesson.

We’re excited to announce that everyone can now use Neo4j AuraDB Free, and get started without a credit card in a number of cloud regions. AuraDB Free is ideal for people who are getting started learning graph, prototyping, and doing early development.

The introduction of AuraDB Free means that you can now sign up and launch a fully-managed Neo4j database free of charge.
Whether you are trying out Neo4j for the first time, working on a prototype application or even looking for a testing environment, this option is for you.

You can start either with an empty database to which you can load your own data or explore the movies dataset.

AuraDB Free databases are free forever, but have a limited graph size of 50k nodes and 175k relationships.
You can get started now without entering credit card details.

The new *4.1* release to the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/spark/4.1/[Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark^] provides new functionality that allows you to produce or consume data to and from Neo4j AuraDB.

Bi-direction streaming with Spark will allow users to perform advanced ETL processes, enrich their data sets and even implement Machine Learning workflows with Spark.
The Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark takes advantage of the spark streaming API and treats Neo4j as any other streaming source.

If you are a Neo4j Aura customer, this release is great news. We’ve made bi-directional integration with Spark streaming possible. You can get started today, whether you’re using Aura Free, Professional, or Enterprise. If you are running Neo4j Enterprise Edition, you can do exactly the same.

Avid fans of https://sandbox.neo4j.com[Neo4j Sandbox^] may have noticed the addition of a new **Twitch** dataset.
This dataset provides a great opportunity to explore the basics of network analysis without having to download and install Neo4j.

After firing up a link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=twitch[new Sandbox instance with the Twitch usecase^], you will be explore the dataset while being introduced to a number of network algorithms from the Graph Data Science library.
The guide will teach you to evaluate overall network statistics, use the PageRank algorithm to determien the most influential streamers, and use Node Similarity algorithms to identify streamers with high crossover in their audiences.

For a more in depth look of the dataset, you can read Tomaz's blog post.

And finally, our friends in Sales and Innovation Rik and Stefan have been at it again, publishing Part 4 in their link:https://www.graphalue.com/[Graphalue^] series, this week presenting some valuable tips on _how_ to present the value case for graphs within your company.

I have spent a lot of time with these two over the years and their I have always found our conversations to be extremely valuable.

I don't know about you, but I'm a huge admirer of Stefan's ability to effortlessly switch between the insightful and the sublime.

== Tweet of the Week

There have been so many great tweets this week, Neo4j certainly go link:https://twitter.com/neo4j/status/1454784998180012040[all out for Halloween] and it's great to see link:https://twitter.com/AJarasch/status/1455673320058277895[in-person conferences] are happening again.

But as a Node.js developer with a keen interest in visualisation, I've got to pick https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^]'s tweet, visualising airport thousands of flight routes between airports using link:https://www.sigmajs.org/[sigma.js^].
