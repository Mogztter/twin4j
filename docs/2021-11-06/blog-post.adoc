Hey everyone!

I'm Adam and I work on the education side of our Dev Rel team, namely our link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com[GraphAcademy^] platform.

I don't know about you, but I always find the week where the clocks fall back in Europe plays havoc with my schedule, especially with the regular meetings arranged by my colleagues over in the US.

For the next month, I will be trawling through the archives to bring you some of the more interesting articles written by our fantastic community members.

You may have already read link:https://medium.com/neo4j/introducing-the-new-graphacademy-45b0df491a23[my blog post introducing the new GraphAcademy site^], but if not I would like to spend a paragraph or two on our new set of courses.

We have tried to focus on your journey as a Neo4j professional and provide you a clear path to a link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/categories/certification/[Neo4j Certification^].


1. The link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/neo4j-fundamentals/[Neo4j Fundamentals^] course is designed to give anyone a high-level understanding of what graphs are and where neo4j fits in your tech stack.
2. One you know what graphs are useful for, you can progress to the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/cypher-fundamentals/[Cypher Fundamentals^] course to learn how to get data out of the graph. The course is hands-on, constantly challenging you as you go.
3. The link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/modeling-fundamentals/[Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals^] course will then provide you with the techniques required to create and refactor your data model for performance.

The Cypher Fundamentals and Graph Data Modeling Fundamentals courses both


// We have decided to develop the curriculum in the open and give our community the ability to affect our road map. You can register your interest for any course listed as _Coming Soon_, and we will take this information into account when we prioritize our work. We are a small team so this feedback is invaluable.

We’re excited to announce that everyone can now use Neo4j AuraDB Free, and get started without a credit card in a number of cloud regions. AuraDB Free is ideal for people who are getting started learning graph, prototyping, and doing early development.

The introduction of AuraDB Free means that you can now sign up and launch a fully-managed Neo4j database free of charge.
Whether you are trying out Neo4j for the first time, working on a prototype application or even looking for a testing environment, this option is for you.

You can start either with an empty database to which you can load your own data or explore the movies dataset.

AuraDB Free databases are free forever, but have a limited graph size of 50k nodes and 175k relationships.
You can get started now without entering credit card details.

The new *4.1* release to the link:https://neo4j.com/developer/spark/4.1/[Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark^] provides new functionality that allows you to produce or consume data to and from Neo4j AuraDB.

Bi-direction streaming with Spark will allow users to perform advanced ETL processes, enrich their data sets and even implement Machine Learning workflows with Spark.
The Neo4j Connector for Apache Spark takes advantage of the spark streaming API and treats Neo4j as any other streaming source.

If you are a Neo4j Aura customer, this release is great news. We’ve made bi-directional integration with Spark streaming possible. You can get started today, whether you’re using Aura Free, Professional, or Enterprise. If you are running Neo4j Enterprise Edition, you can do exactly the same.
