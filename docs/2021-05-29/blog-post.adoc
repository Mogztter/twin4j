Hello, everyone!

Don't miss our free hands-on training sessions the week before NODES 2021. All folks who register for NODES can attend these sessions (scroll down for details).

In this week's episode, Tomaz Bratanic provides a comprehensive tutorial for setting up your environment so you can analyze Twitch data. One of our Neo4j engineers, Gerrit Meier has written a Developer Guide for configuring java drivers to use Quarkus, Helidon, or Micronaut. Charlotte Skardon shares some helpful tips for those of you who want to set up Encryption for your Causal Cluster deployments. Bryant Avey has posted a blog that steps you through how to use Neo4j as a source of data for Power BI. The folks at DataFitter have published an article about  how they used Neo4j, Machine Learning, and GraphQL to help with their analysis of carbohydrate genomes.

In addition, we have included a link to the recorded presentation that Vladimir Bacvanski and Deepak Chandramoul  from PayPal did at NODES 2020 entitled _Mastering Enterprise Metadata with Neo4j_.

Cheers,

https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz[Tomaz Bratanic^]  has just published a comprehensive tutorial on how to set up your Neo4j Desktop environment so that you can analyze Twitch data. He explains the Twitch network model and how to start exploring real data with Cypher. Then he delves into some of the Neo4j Graph Data Science Library algorithms and uses Community Detection to understand the connections in the data.

https://twitter.com/CSkardon[Charlotte Skardon^] has gone through the arduous process of getting SSL to work with Neo4j Causal Clusters. In this blog, she steps you through what you can do to use both self-signed and proper Certificates.  Her focus in these steps is setting up for secure intra-cluster communication.

https://twitter.com/BryantAvey[Bryant Avey^], posted a tutorial that steps you through importing data from a graph to Power BI. It covers how to use the default version of the Neo4j HTTP API with Power BI. Utilizing the Web API method allows all queries written for the REST API to be utilized in Power BIâ€™s online service.

Last year, at NODES, https://twitter.com/OnSoftware[Vladimir Bacvanski^] and https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepakmc[Deepak Chandramoul], from PayPal presented this session where introduced us to how they build their application to combine data from many sources and used Gimel, Spark, and Kafka to stream data into Neo4j for analysis. They shared how they architected their application, as well as the GitHub repo that contains their work. Graph Algorithms and GraphQL also played an important role in their application.
