== Featured Community Member: Shiny Zhu
:tags: nodes, china, shanghai, flights

This week's featured community member is Shiny Zhu.

featured::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210910055644/this-week-in-neo4j-11-September-2021.jpeg[name="Shiny Zhu"]

I'm super excited about Shiny Zhu joining our team as our first Developer Advocate in Asia Pacific, out of Shanghai China. 

Shiny has a https://www.linkedin.com/in/shinyzhu/[impressive history^], he's a full stack developer, was very active in the .Net and Python communities and is a long-time Microsoft MVP.

Even before joining he got active in our graph community, learned and shared about Neo4j, attended the Shanghai meetup and even got certified.

Shiny already hit the ground running establishing a https://bbs.csdn.net/forums/neo4j[Neo4j presence in CSDN^] and publishing his first two articles on representing a flight data model in a graph in https://dev.to/shinyzhu/my-first-graph-data-model-using-neo4j-to-store-flight-schedule-data-25i2[English^] and https://shinyzhu.com/2021/09/05/flight-schdule-in-graph-database-neo4j/[Chinese^].

So it would be great if you followed him on social media and reach out to him with questions and suggestions for topics, events, content and more.

== Answering Frequent Questions: Relational vs Graph

A frequent question we get especially from new users is - how do graph databases compare with relational databases.
How can you transform the models, import data, how do queries between SQL and Cypher relate.

Lju gives us a deep dive in her article on FreeCodeCamp, covering all these topics.

== Coming up: Neo4j Training Week September 13-17
:tags: training, aura, bloom, graphql, knowledge-graph, introduction

First of all I wanted to remind you of our upcoming training week.

Lju has written a great article covering the topics.

Those super interactive, live classes will help you get started with: 

* Neo4j the graph database
* Aura Free in our cloud service
* Bloom graph visualization and exploration
* GraphQL integration for Neo4j to build APIs quickly
* Knowledge graphs using NLP and GDS (Graph Data Science)

Please make sure to either join one of the sessions or share the opportunity with your colleagues, friends and family - no one is to young or old to enjoy the power of graphs.

== Authorization Solutions for Microservices Architecture
:tags: authorization, microservices, opa, policy-based-auth, pbac

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210910055633/auth-opa.png[width=150,float="right"]

Architect Olga Kogan from our customer AppsFlyer shares their approach to securely managing Microservices.

ApplFlyer manages insights data for APIs and mobile services and uses Neo4j as part of the access control and authorization servicce that is used for each microservice, as a global approach at the REST API layer is not fine grained enough.
And their needs are very specific due to privacy, legal and data sensitivity requirements.

They use a Policy based access control (PBAC) with the Rego scripting language from Open Policy Agent (OPA), a CNCF project to implement a more flexible approach that can use different pieces of contextual information to request authorization decisions.

Neo4j serves as the permission management engine that allows real-time policy and permission changes for each customer, partner and service/action.

== Suadeo - what are you watching?
:tags: recommendations, mobile, movies, shows, ios, android

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210910055642/suadeo.png[width=150,float="right"]

We were really impressed by Suadeo, a Neo4j backed free mobile app for iOS and Android that allows you to share what you watch with your friends and build (suadeo-)lists of interesting shows and movies to watch from your peers.

Neo4j community member mbazos spent a year in the Neo4j community learning and building the app and is happy to release it now and is interested in your feedback.

== Slides: Knowledge Graph Browser for a Property Graph in Neo4j
:tags: knowledge-graph, rdf, neo4j, neosemantics

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210910055636/kg-slides.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/gatemezing[Ghislain Atemezing^] from Mondeca (Paris) shared the slides from Semantics Conf (Amsterdam) on how they publish and browse a knowledge-graph using Neo4j.

RDF subjects are mapped to nodes in the graph, and predicates (triples and literals) to relationships (which is not the ideal model as it's too fine grained and doesn't utilize the "property" graph for the literals). 
They built an infrastructure for a Knowledge Graph Browser using Spring, Neo4j and Elastic.
There are some live deployments to explorate at http://mef-prod.mondeca.com/index

== Favorite Graph Algorithms from our Favorite Friends
:tags: graph-algorithms, video, youtube, book review

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/OReilly-Graph-Algorithms_v2_ol1.jpg[width=150,float="right"]

Two of our favorite contributors are back for a joint feature.

Join https://twitter.com/AshleighNFaith[Ashleigh Faith^] and https://twitter.com/davidmeza1[David Meza^ ] while exploring their favorite graph algorithms of the graph data science library in this 15 minute video with a calming river in the background.

They introduce the book with it's intro to graphs, Neo4j and Apache Spark and explore one algorithm per chapter. Explaining the approach of the book with background and history, explanation of the algorithm, how to use it and the examples in Spark and Neo4j.

Here are the algorithms they are talking about:

* Path-Finding: All-Pairs-Shortest Paths
* Centrality: Betweenness Centrality (finding bridges between clusters)
* Clustering: Triangle Counting + Clustering Coefficent (interconnectedness)
* Clustering: Louvain 
* Machine Learning: Graph Embeddings

== Visualize Stock Volume Similarity with Neo4j, GDS, and Power BI
:tags: graph-data-science, power-bi, data-visualization, temporal, stocks

image::https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20210910055638/power-bi.png[width=150,float="right"]

https://twitter.com/BryantAvey[Bryant Avey^] explains in his article how to surface patterns detected in a neo4j graph automatically in Power BI by running PowerQuery templates that auto-refresh and execute multiple Cypher queries in bulk.

He uses the daily stock price history data from TD Ameritrade represented as a linked list of history nodes. 

The raw data was enriched by using the GDS KNN algorithm to find similarities between stock trade volumes across different stocks and days and then running Louvain to show clusters of similiar groups of nodes. 

In PowerBI the similarity and volume data was explored using timeline analytics and candlestick charts to identify temporal patterns of price and later volume correlations visualized in correlation charts.

He presented the approach at the Power BI bootcamp, which is really cool.

In a https://medium.com/codex/importing-neo4j-graph-data-with-power-bi-d2686e9255bc[previous article^] he showed how to load data from Neo4j into Power BI using the HTTP API and custom PowerBI templates for executing the POST requests with Auth and custom result parsing.
