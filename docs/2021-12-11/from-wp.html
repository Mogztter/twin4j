  Do you remember the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pandora Papers</a> - the latest leak from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)? As you know, the ICIJ uses Neo4j to find the hidden connections in the vast numbers of files and data. They have now made the first data-release of that leak available and Michael Hunger dove right in. 
  <br/>
  Furthermore, this week is completely decked out with Data Science topics. We are exploring Knowledge Graphs with Named Entity Recognition or text analyse Electronic Health Records. In addition to these two great articles we invite you to watch Clair's Video this week about Graph Embeddings.

  Enjoy this week's edition of Twin4j.<br/>

  Ashleigh specializes in multilingual search and behavioral analytics, focused on semantics, interoperability, and natural language, and realized through ontologies and knowledge graph. Her domain focus is STEM subject matter -particularly in transportation, mechanical, medical, and electrical engineering technology, but I have worked on eCommerce, Business Intelligence, and Network Analysis data as well. 
  She is an active member of the community and striving to educate others of the value, power, and importance of knowledge graphs. For this she was awarded the <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/the-results-are-in-here-are-this-years-graphie-award-winners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neo4j Graphie Award 2021</a></p>

  <p>Just a few days ago, the Pulitzer Award winning International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published the first data-release of the recent Pandora Papers investigation. This time the data publication was not split across the different investigations but contains the full offshoreleaks database in one dataset, so you can explore the data of shell companies, law firms, banks, and ultimate owners across all leaks and investigations.
  Dive into the data with Michael Hunger and find out how officers are related with Entities, Intermediaries and Shell Companies.</p>

  <p>Learn from Walid Amamou about how to build a knowledge graph from job descriptions using fine-tuned transformer-based
  Named Entity Recognition (NER) and spacy's relation extraction models. The method described here
  can be used in many different fields such as biomedical, finance, healthcare and beyond.</p>

  <p>Zeljko gives a hands-on tutorial on making biomedical concepts extracted from free text easily accessible to clinicians and researchers. 
  Biomedical NER+L is concerned with extracting concepts from free text found in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and linking them to large biomedical databases like SNOMED-CT and UMLS. In this post, Zeljko focuses on what to do once concepts are extracted from free text, in other words, how to make them useful to clinicians and other researchers.</p>
