== Directory structure

Newsletters are inside the [.path]_docs_ directory with one folder per newsletter using `yyyy-MM-dd` format.

`images/`::
A directory that contains all the images used in the blog post.
NOTE: The file name will be used as a slug, make sure to use a descriptive name.

`blog-post.adoc`::
A blog post (AsciiDoc file). Must contain:

* Document title
* Attributes:
** `slug`: unique slug
** `author`: author name used on WordPress
** `categories`: list of slugs
** `tags`: list of slugs
+
Example:
+
```adoc

:slug: this-week-in-neo4j-graph-embeddings-reddit-jqassistant-helidon-corporate-data-query-tuning
:author: Elaine Rosenberg
:categories: graph database

Information about the featured community member (JSON file). Must contain:

- `name`: complete name (first name and last name) of the featured community member
- `title`: job title of the featured community member

+

+
```json

}
```
<1> Image must be located inside the [.path]_images_ directory.
+
TIP: Featured community member images are usually taken from LinkedIn.
On a https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hay-2664335/[LinkedIn profile], you can left-clik on the profile picture, it should open a popup with an high-resolution image, then right-click and "Save image as".
Save the image in the [.path]_images_ directory using a slug (for instance, `chris-hay.jpeg`).

== Usage

First, make sure that you have https://nodejs.org/[Node] >= 14 LTS installed on your machine.
Then, install the dependencies using `npm`:

 $ npm i

Once this is done, you can run tasks using `npm`.

TIP: You can run `npm run` to output the list of tasks available.

=== Tasks

==== Generate

 $ npm run generate <issue-date>

For instance, if you want to generate the Twin4j newsletter of May 22th, 2021:

 $ npm run generate 2021-05-22

TIP: Check that everything looks correct by reviewing files generated in the [.path]_build/<issue-date>_ directory.

==== Publish

In order to publish images and blog posts to WordPress, you need to define the following environment variables:

- `WORDPRESS_USERNAME`
- `WORDPRESS_PASSWORD`

IMPORTANT: You first need to generate an issue using `npm run generate <issue-date>` before publishing.

Publish tasks will create or update existing images or blog posts based on the slug.
Therefore, you should not update slugs once the content has been published.
 you can run upload tasks multiple times if you

.Publish images to WordPress
 $ npm run publish-images <issue-date>

.Publish blog post to WordPress
 $ npm run publish-blog-post <issue-date>

NOTE: Please note that the blog post will be scheduled (using the status `future`) and will be automatically published by WordPress at 00:01 PST (i.e., 08:00 UTC) on Saturday (i.e., the issue date)

=== Debug

You can use the `DEBUG` environment variable to enable traces based on space or comma-delimited names. +
Here are some examples:

```
$ DEBUG=generate npm run generate 2021-05-15
